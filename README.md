# predicate-name-of-plant-
In this project, I reviewed the machine learning subject, where we downloaded data (images of plant leaves),
then the images were processed to extract the most important features that can be adopted to identify this plant, 
then I tried several models (SVM , PCA ,NAIV , DECISION TREE ,KNN ,..) and compared their results, and we processed the features and extracted the important features(Feature Selection
)
and i use parameter tuning
